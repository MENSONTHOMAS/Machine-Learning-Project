# Car Price Prediction

## Overview

The Car Price Prediction Dataset contains various car features along with their prices. It is used to build machine learning models to predict car prices based on different specifications. This dataset helps understand the key factors influencing car prices and aids in making strategic business decisions.

## Dataset Information

- Total Records: 205
- Total Features: 26 (before encoding categorical variables)
- Target Variable: price (Car price in USD)

## Best Model: Random Forest Regressor

The Random Forest Regressor model provided the best results for predicting car prices with the following evaluation metrics:
- **Mean Absolute Error** (MAE): 0.1923
- **Mean Squared Error** (MSE): 0.0607
- **Root Mean Squared Error** (RMSE): 0.2464
- **R-squared (R²) Score**: 0.9377

This high R² score indicates that the model explains 93.77% of the variance in car prices, making it a strong predictive model.

## Business Use Case

This dataset helps in:
- *Understanding the key factors affecting car prices*.
- *Building machine learning models for price prediction*.
- *Assisting automobile companies in pricing strategies and market positioning*.

### How to Use This Dataset

- Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand trends.
- Apply Feature Engineering to select the most relevant variables.
- Train machine learning models such as Random Forest Regressor.
- Optimize performance using hyperparameter tuning.
